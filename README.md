# Boot-Sector-Code

I wrote a program that uses BOIS routines to print some stuff.
NOTE: A lot of the code was copyed from this tutorial:
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf

I have no problem copying this code because writing it myself would be a massive pain.
Writing assembly language is probably one of the most painful things I have done in
my entire life.

Also to use code from the 'test-code' directory you will have to move it into main project.
As in 'cp filename.asm ../'. But I'm going to get higher level code working
soon, so their is no need to worry about it.
