# Boot-Sector-Code

I wrote a program that uses BOIS routines to print some stuff.
NOTE: A lot of the code was copyed from this tutorial:
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf

I have no problem copying this code because writing it myself would be a massive pain.
Writing assembly language is probably one of the most painful things I have done in
my entire life.
